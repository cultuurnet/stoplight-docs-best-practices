# Introduction

Welcome to our internal API design and documentation guidelines! 👋 

This space is meant to share tips and best practices how to design and document your API on Stoplight so that our approach is consistent across projects and as clear as possible for integrators. Click on a guide in the sidebar to find out more about how to take your design and documentation to the next level!

Additionally we also have some pages about creating new Stoplight projects and managing their settings, so that everything works as smoothly as possible for you and everyone helping to document your API.

Enjoy and go build some great APIs!

> **Take your time to go through this documentation.** ☕️ It may seem easier to dive in and start designing and documenting your API as fast as possible, but these guides will ensure that your API is designed and documented in a way that will require far less changes down the line to make it production-ready.
