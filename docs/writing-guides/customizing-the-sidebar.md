# Customizing the sidebar

You can customize the sidebar of your project, for example to change the order of pages.

See Stoplight's documentation how to customize your sidebar: https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/4.-documentation/d.table-of-contents.md

Make sure that your `toc.json` file is in the **root** of your project files, not inside `docs` or another directory.

An example of a Stoplight project with a customized sidebar is the [Authentication](https://publiq.stoplight.io/docs/authentication) project.
