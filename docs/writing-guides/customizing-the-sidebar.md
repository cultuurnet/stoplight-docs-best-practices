# Customizing the sidebar

You can customize the sidebar of your project, for example to change the order of pages, by adding a `toc.json` file to your project to describe the intended structure of your sidebar.

See Stoplight's documentation for more information: https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/4.-documentation/d.table-of-contents.md

<!-- theme: warning -->

> Make sure that your `toc.json` file is in the **root** of your project files, not inside `docs` or another directory.
