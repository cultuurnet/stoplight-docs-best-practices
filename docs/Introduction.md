# Introduction

Welcome to our internal Stoplight usage guidelines! ðŸ‘‹ 

This space is meant to share tips and best practices how to document your publiq APIs on Stoplight, so that our documentation style is consistent across projects and as clear as possible for readers. Click on a guide in the sidebar to find out more about how to take your documentation to the next level!

Additionally we also have some pages about creating new Stoplight projects and managing their settings, so that everything works as smoothly as possible for you and everyone helping to write documentation.

Enjoy and go write some great documentation!
